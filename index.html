                Ok. So I’m one step below a noob...this group is so selfless. There’s no greed, it’s open dialogue to share tips and best practices. Never in my wildest dreams did I think something like this was out there. You are never made to feel dumb regardless of what questions you may have. It’s more than just the admins too, everyone wants each other to succeed and that is rare in today’s society. I’m so glad I was reading through the ‘when lambo’ or ‘this $0.10 stock is going to $2.00 so buy now’ comments and stumbled across this. Such a great group of like minded people! So maybe I’ve graduated to noob because of this group!

                When the pandemic hit in 2020, I was standing at work. I saw how bad the stock market was and I thought... it would be a real good time to buy some of the stocks like oil or airlines maybe cruise stock. So I left work got on YouTube and watched a bunch of ppl that made it look easy. Finally ended up on webull and that’s how I found this group of amazing ppl. I didn’t have a clue and didn’t have much money. This group has helped me so much with learning how to trade. I would recommend it to anyone. So helpful and they have always answered all my questions.

                My turn. Joining this group has been a good experience from the start. Like so many others I had stepped into a world I didn't understand but was intrigued by. Along the way every question was answered and support for one another is constant. The time and resources the management dedicate to creating and maintaining resources for everyone is something to be admired.  They want you to succeed and will always give you a nudge in the right direction. Thank you to them and thank you to the rest of the group. You're all an island of hope in a confusing world.

              Ok. So I just joined this group about a week and a half ago. Before this group I couldn’t tell you what an option was or what a Candle stick was. Hell I couldn’t even tell you what an ema was but since I have been in this group I now am at a point where I know what all this is and I am getting more confident by the day with being able to see when to enter a trade and when to get out of a trade. Now I am trying to wrap my head around doing all the research on these stocks when it comes to the ERs and other news about a company. I want especially thank @Bulls&Beats#4543 for helping my brother who in turn showed me. Now with all that said today was my highest earnings day since I started investing about a week and a half ago. Thank you @Dumplyng#9618 @Pennybags#4565 @smfrytommy#6095 and anyone else that may have answered any questions that I may have asked or my continue to ask cause I still have a long way to go but I am determined to learn all I can to be a better trader.

              Hey @everyone I'm one of the quieter folks on this discord, maybe i've asked 2 or 3 questions. But I'd like to let all of you know that what you're doing, even by being a part of this group, is really appreciated and is a wonderful thing. New people like me have a lot to learn and a difficult time finding honest opinions. It's not just about profit for a lot of us at the start, it's about hope, and finding a reason to keep trying, especially if you're passionate. The group of you I've witnessed for the past few months, you're decent people. I've learned more than just how to trade, I've also learned that not everyone in the Stockspace is looking to use someone else or just make stepping stones out of you. You guys are human. And I, for one, really appreciate that experience. Happy 4th of July to everyone, and thanks again to the @deleted-role for creating this and keeping it going. Your hard work and passion doesn't go unappreciated.

      <h2 class="text-center display-4">Rules</h2>
      <br><br>
      <p class="p">Code of Conduct: <br> <br>
        1)    Maintain conversation in correct channels (i.e. video game chats in #🎮gaming-chatter🕹 and NSFW content in the #🍸bar-talk🍺 channel).  This is important to maintain integrity of the channels to ensure people get correct news when needed for making best decisions and allowing proper DD.
        <br><br> 2)    Respect everyone and leave ego at the door.  There’s no room for any sort of disrespecting of any member based on any difference of opinion or beliefs.  Offenders may face punishment up to and including termination from server.
        <br><br>3)    Nurture the established culture of caring. We are here as a group of friends and family to help each other learn and grow.  Our mission is to ensure growth through learning and learning through group thought.
        <br><br>4)    Do not ask for exit and entry points.  We can offer advice and strategies as a group but it is your responsibility to do your own due diligence (DD) for your investments.  Exit and entry strategies may be discussed but be prepared with your own information and strategies for analysis.
        <br><br>5)    Do NOT attempt to make calls without thorough explanation of the reasoning behind your play.  Chart analysis, exit/entry strategy, or a new company announcement significantly impacting the company can all be used, but as a group we should not be focused on a hot play that could potentially be a pump and dump that could significantly impact the financial health of our members.
        <br><br>
        6) No advertising of other servers what so ever. Run it by admin first or auto - BAN</p>
